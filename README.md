In  the Pandas Assingment, we were asked to analyze the data from a dataset of high schools. Throughout the data analysis we analyzed the two school types (charter and district), school budgets, student body size and budget per student. Those results were then compared to the results of the scores on math and reading tests. As I analyzed the dataset, I have come to two concrete conclusions. First, charter schools seem to have higher test scores and have higher passing percentages by their student body. Second, on average it appears that the bigger the size of the student body the lower the test scores and lower passing percentage. One of the more surprising conclusions that seemed to appear in the data was that a higher budget per student did not result in higher test scores.
